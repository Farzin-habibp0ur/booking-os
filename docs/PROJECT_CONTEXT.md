### Auth & Multi-tenancy

- JWT in httpOnly cookies (access: 15 min, refresh: 7 days), automatic client-side refresh on 401
- Cookie domain auto-derived from `CORS_ORIGINS` for subdomain sharing (`.businesscommandcentre.com`)
- `sameSite: lax`, `secure: true` in production — see DEPLOY.md section 6 for critical rules
- Token blacklisting on logout and password change
- `TenantGuard` + `@BusinessId()` for tenant isolation
- `@Roles()` + `RolesGuard` for role-based access
- Brute force protection: 5 failed attempts = 15-min lockout
- Rate limiting per endpoint (signup: 3/min, login: 10/min, etc.)

## 10. CI/CD Pipeline

```
Push to main → lint-and-test → docker-build → deploy (Railway) → smoke-test
Pull request → lint-and-test → docker-build (no deploy, no smoke test)
```

- **lint-and-test:** PostgreSQL 16 service, Prisma generate + migrate, format check, lint, test
- **smoke-test:** Post-deploy production verification (20 checks: health, DB, auth, security headers, CORS, public endpoints)
- **docker-build:** Multi-stage Docker builds for API and web
- **deploy:** `railway up --service api/web --detach` (async — takes 2-5 min after CI)
- **Migrations:** Auto-run via `scripts/docker-entrypoint.sh` on container startup
- **Full docs:** `docs/cicd.md` and `DEPLOY.md`

| JWT      | `JWT_SECRET`, `JWT_REFRESH_SECRET`                   | Always                                     |
| URLs     | `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL`          | Always                                     |
| CORS     | `CORS_ORIGINS`                                       | Production (also determines cookie domain) |
| AI       | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`                                  | AI features                                |
| WhatsApp | `WHATSAPP_*`                                         | Production messaging                       |
| Stripe   | `STRIPE_*`                                           | Billing                                    |

**Critical:** `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` vars are baked at build time. `CORS_ORIGINS` drives cookie domain. See `DEPLOY.md` section 6.

### Do Not Build (Yet)

- Don't chase additional verticals beyond the current 4 (aesthetic, dealership, wellness, general) before ROI is repeatable
- Don't overinvest in generic AI chatbot; keep AI tied to structured flows
- Don't build deep enterprise features before pack-led implementation is nailed
